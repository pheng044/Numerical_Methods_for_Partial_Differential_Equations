# Numerical Methods for Partial Differential Equations
### P.V. Heng

Set of MATLAB scripts and functions created and presented for the Spring 2025 offering of 'Numerical Methods for Partial Differential Equations' at the University of Massachusetts, Lowell. Topics include but are not limited to finite difference methods, domain mappings, finite volume methods, and finite element methods and their application to engineering problems.
